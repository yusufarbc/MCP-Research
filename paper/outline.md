# MCP Protocol Security — Paper Outline

- Title: Model Context Protocol (MCP) Security: Threats, Defenses, and Deployment Guidance
- Authors: TBD
- Abstract: TBD (200–250 words)

Sections
- Introduction
  - Motivation, scope, contributions
  - Summary of findings
- Background
  - MCP architecture and message flows
  - Trust boundaries and components (client, server, transport)
- Threat Model
  - Adversaries, assumptions, assets, security goals
  - Attack surface (tool servers, plugins, A2A, file/FS, network)
- Vulnerabilities and Attacks
  - Prompt/tool poisoning; plan injection; RCE; SSRF/DNS rebinding; authn/z gaps; supply chain
  - Case studies (e.g., exposed servers, fake packages, CVEs)
- Defenses and Best Practices
  - Isolation/sandboxing; least privilege; validation; policy enforcement; observability; rate limiting
  - Protocol-level proposals (signatures, capability descriptors, attestation)
- Evaluation (if applicable)
  - Benchmarks, attack success rates, mitigation efficacy
- Related Work
  - Agent frameworks; plugin ecosystems; API security parallels
- Conclusion
  - Recommendations, open problems, future work
