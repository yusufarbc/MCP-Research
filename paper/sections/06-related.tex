Prior analyses document risks in agent frameworks and plugin ecosystems that generalize to MCP: prompt injection and tool poisoning, insufficient isolation, and supply-chain exposures \cite{arXiv250323278,arXiv250812566}. Operational studies highlight the prevalence of misconfigurations in exposed services and the importance of least privilege and monitoring \cite{MDPIElectronics3267}. Recent work explores resilient workflow orchestration with function-as-a-service backends for tool invocation, which can reduce blast radius and simplify isolation \cite{arXiv250907595}. Domain-specific proposals (e.g., bioinformatics tools) illustrate how capability scoping and auditing support safe integration \cite{arXiv250708055}.
