We presented a concise threat model and an attack taxonomy for MCP deployments, along with pragmatic defenses and operational guidance. The central theme is disciplined trust management across client–server–tool boundaries, combined with isolation, least privilege, validation, and observability. Future work includes formal capability descriptors, server attestation mechanisms, and comparative evaluations of isolation strategies (e.g., containers vs. microVMs) under representative workloads.
