Assets
- Confidential data: API keys, credentials, customer or proprietary data.
- Integrity of actions: tool invocations, file edits, code execution results.
- Availability: client/server uptime, rate limits, cost budgets.

Adversaries
- External attacker over the network.
- Malicious or compromised tool/server provider (supply chain).
- Insider or compromised operator endpoint.

Assumptions
- Transport provides confidentiality/integrity (TLS) but endpoints may be untrusted.
- Models may hallucinate; prompts can be injected via content or tool metadata.
- Tools differ in blast radius (filesystem vs. read-only HTTP).

Security goals
- Confidentiality: prevent secret leakage via tool responses and logs.
- Integrity: prevent unauthorized or unintended side effects.
- Availability: bound resource usage; degrade safely under attack.

Trust boundaries
- Client ↔ Server: authentication, authorization, capability negotiation.
- Server ↔ Tools: isolation and policy enforcement.
- User ↔ Model: prompt hygiene, content filtering, user consent/approval.
