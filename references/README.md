# References Directory

This folder stores reference materials used during research and writing.

- `academic/`: Publisher or arXiv PDFs for offline reading.
- `resources/`: Supporting PDFs (protocol summaries, abstract collections, etc.).

Guidelines
- Prefer concise filenames (e.g., `2509.07595v1.pdf`, `electronics-14-03267-v2.pdf`).
- Respect licenses of all materials; these files are for research purposes only.
- Cite sources via `paper/bibliography/references.bib` and keep `CITATIONS.md` updated with URLs and access dates.
